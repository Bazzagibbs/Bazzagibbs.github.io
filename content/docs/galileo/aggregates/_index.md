WIP

Planned: 
- `Material` - Associates a `shader` with uniforms (`images`, etc.)
- `Model` - Associates a `mesh` and `materials` (one per vertex group)
- `Construct` - Somewhere between a scene and prefab. Transform hierarchy with hardpoints.
- `Archive` - A compressed collection of many related assets.
