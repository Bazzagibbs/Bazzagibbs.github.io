techniques and 
HTML5 tags 
throughout. There is a 
high level 
understanding of CSS.

content and 
presentation will be 
noticeable. Complex 
nesting of HTML and 
CSS selectors is used.
Code is formatted and 
well-presented.

### Graphics
Graphics augment the 
theme/purpose of the 
site, communicate 
information not 
evident in the text, 
are thoughtfully	
cropped (as 
appropriate), enhance 
the content. Images 
are resized to 
requirements. Clear 
understanding of 
difference between 
graphics as content 
and graphics as part 
of the design. There 
are no broken images.

pages.

### Fonts

number	and	type	of	
fonts	are	used	
consistently	across	
pages	and	size	varies
