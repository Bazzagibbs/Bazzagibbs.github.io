### Technical proficiency
Student uses current techniques and HTML5 tags throughout. There is a high level understanding of CSS. A clear separation of content and presentation will be noticeable. Complex nesting of HTML and CSS selectors is used. Code is formatted and well-presented.

### Graphics
Graphics augment the theme/purpose of the site, communicate information not evident in the text, are thoughtfully cropped (as appropriate), enhance the content. Images are resized to requirements. Clear understanding of difference between graphics as content and graphics as part of the design. There are no broken images. 

### Layout

### Navigation
Links for navigation are clearly labelled, allow the user to easily move between pages and external sites. External links open in new tab/window. Navigation  links utilise different presentation for different states. Navigation is consistently placed and labelled. Navigation indicates active link.

### Colour choices
Colours of backgrounds, fonts and links to do not detract from and enhance the content, form a thoughtful and complementary palette and are consistent across pages.

### Fonts
An appropriate number and type of fonts are used consistently across pages and size varies appropriately for headings and text. Use of font styles (italics, bold, underline) and spacing (not including `<br>`) is used consistently and appropriately to improve readability. 

### Content
